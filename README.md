## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach to data analysis:

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing of the churn dataset
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding data patterns, distributions, and relationships
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating and transforming features for modeling
4. **Modeling**: Building predictive models to identify churn risk factors
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance and extracting insights
6. **Recommendations**: Actionable insights based on analysis results

## Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and analysis
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Machine learning libraries for predictive modeling

## Getting Started
